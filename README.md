Analysis on soccer data

This project aims to analyze the type of bet called "Accumulator", in which bets are accumulated (parlay) on many soccer matches. Many great proejcts and analyzes have been done in the past, and therefore this is trying to explore some of the pitfalls / benefits of working with accumulated bets. At this moment it is only focused on European Soccer (using the European Soccer Database) and it does not include any data for the present season. Ideally this would be an ono-going script that relies on up-to-date data to validate if that betting strategy still holds.
